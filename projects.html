            <h3>Rart <em>(March 5th - 6th 2016)</em>:</h3>
            <p>Rart is an automatic resume templating application that guides a user through creating their resume. It prompts the user to answer questions that will then be used in creating their resume. It features a smart resume functionality which takes alternate skills that the user may have and matches them to a job description, thus making a more relevant resume to a job. This was created in 24 hours during HackUMBC 2016 by myself and a partner. My responsibility was creating the application</p>
            <p>It was built using Python libraries PyQt4 and pydocx</p>

            <h3>MetaDota <em>(October 2015 - Present)</em>:</h3>
            <p>MetaDota is a web application that displays heroes from the popular video game DotA 2 and their win rate, pick rate, and score that is assigned using an algorithm I made. My algorithm creates a score contribution from both the win rate and pick rate of each hero to create a score representative of both how popular and how well a hero is doing in the current state of the game. The win rate and score of each hero is obtained by scraping a popular dota stats site. The app is continuously being improved and maintained by myself.</p>
            <p>It was built using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, pjscrape, PhantomJS, and Jade</p>
