        <p id="aboutMe">I am a current undergraduate attending UMBC and planning to graduate with a major in Computer Science and minor in Math in 2019. My goal is to eventually become a software engineer but in the mean time I make web apps. Programming is my passion and I am determined to one day reach my goal. Besides programming, I like to go to the gym, play guitar, play video games and watch Netflix.</p>
